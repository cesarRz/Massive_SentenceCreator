1. Use "Browse files" button to select the CSV file from where you want to create the massive sentences
2. Type the sentence you want, replacing the column value with the name of the column with a @ before. Example:

| Name  | University | Class       |
| Cesar | Anahuac    | Programming |

The written phrase could be:    
    
    "@Name is taking @Class at @University".

Which will show as:

    "Cesar is taking Programming at Anahuac".

Then just save the file.
